# What`s CountClickKey
**CountClickKey** - this is a program designed to collect statistics on keystrokes on the keyboard and output it based on the collected data. The statistics section itself is divided into time periods and key types.

The project was created to find out how many keys I press over a certain period of time. It is also a practice for me to learn a programming language. This application is the result of my first work.

# Usage Information
In order for the program to read your keystrokes, you need to run it. You can minimize the program and continue working. The program interface has a statistics section where you can view information on the collected data and sort them by time period, 
as well as by type of keys. In the help section, you can find answers to your questions.
